;; Description:
;;
;; ycmd is a modular server that provides completion for C/C++/ObjC
;; and Python, among other languages. This module provides an emacs
;; client for that server.
;;
;; ycmd is a bit peculiar in a few ways. First, communication with the
;; server uses HMAC to authenticate HTTP messages. The server is
;; started with an HMAC secret that the client uses to generate hashes
;; of the content it sends. Second, the server gets this HMAC
;; information (as well as other configuration information) from a
;; file that the server deletes after reading. So when the code in
;; this module starts a server, it has to create a file containing the
;; secret code. Since the server deletes this file, this code has to
;; create a new one for each server it starts. Hopefully by knowing
;; this, you'll be able to make more sense of some of what you see
;; below.
;;
;; For more details, see the project page at
;; https://github.com/abingham/emacs-ycmd.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; ycmd depends on the following packages:
;;
;;   request
;;
;; Copy this file to to some location in your emacs load path. Then add
;; "(require 'ycmd)" to your emacs initialization (.emacs,
;; init.el, or something).
;;
;; Example config:
;;
;;   (require 'ycmd)
;;
;; Basic usage:
;;
;; First you'll want to configure a few things. If you've got a global ycmd config file, you can specify that with
;; ycmd-global-config:
;;
;;   (set-variable 'ycmd-global-config "/path/to/global_conf.py")
;;
;; Then you'll want to configure your "extra-config whitelist"
;; patterns. These patterns determine which extra-conf files will get
;; loaded automatically by ycmd. So, for example, if you want to make
;; sure that ycmd will automatically load all of the extra-conf files
;; underneath your "~/projects" directory, do this:
;;
;;   (set-variable 'ycmd-extra-conf-whitelist '("~/projects/*"))
;;
;; Now, the first time you open a file for which ycmd can perform
;; completions, a ycmd server will be automatically started.
;;
;; Use 'ycmd-get-completions to get completions at some point in a
;; file. For example:
;;
;;   (ycmd-get-completions)
;;
;; You can use 'ycmd-display-completions to toy around with completion
;; interactively and see the shape of the structures in use.
